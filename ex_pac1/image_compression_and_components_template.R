# but the feature values in each row have been reconstructed from a low-dimensional PCA projection of the original
# 100-dimensional featuredata.

# "featuredata", and has as many rows as you have principal components. Each row of this matrix should contain 
# the principal component projection direction for one of the principal components.

# "principalcomponents" matrix have been created. Note that the code draws two images: you will need to
