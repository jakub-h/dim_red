% and whose columns are the 100 pixels of each block (taken pixel-column by pixel-column, pixel-row by pixel-row from each block).

%==============================INSERT YOUR CODE BELOW=====================

% Insert your own code between these lines to solve this exercise. 
%
% Your code should create a new matrix "reconstructed_featuredata" which is the same size as "featuredata", 
% but the feature values in each row have been reconstructed from a low-dimensional PCA projection of the original
% 100-dimensional featuredata.
%
% Your code should also create a new matrix "principalcomponents" which has the same number of columns as
% "featuredata", and has as many rows as you have principal components. Each row of this matrix should contain
% the principal component projection direction for one of the principal components.
% 
% The rest of the code below these lines assumes that the "reconstructed_featuredata" matrix and the
% "principalcomponents" matrix have been created. Note that the code draws two images: you will need to
% press the Enter key to continue from the first image to the second.
